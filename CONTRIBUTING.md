## Executables vs Rake tasks

Executables shipped by dependencies, such as kettle-dev, and stone_checksums, are available
after running `bin/setup`. These include:

1. - gem_checksums
2. - kettle-changelog
3. - kettle-commit-msg
4. - kettle-dev-setup
5. - kettle-dvcs
6. - kettle-pre-release
7. - kettle-readme-backers
8. - kettle-release
There are many Rake tasks available as well. You can see them by running:

```shell
bin/rake -T
```

## Environment Variables for Local Development

Below are the primary environment variables recognized by stone_checksums (and its integrated tools). Unless otherwise noted, set boolean values to the string "true" to enable.

General/runtime
1. - DEBUG: Enable extra internal logging for this library (default: false)
2. - REQUIRE_BENCH: Enable `require_bench` to profile requires (default: false)
3. - CI: When set to true, adjusts default rake tasks toward CI behavior
Coverage (kettle-soup-cover / SimpleCov)
1. - K_SOUP_COV_DO: Enable coverage collection (default: true in `mise.toml`)
2. - K_SOUP_COV_FORMATTERS: Comma-separated list of formatters (html, xml, rcov, lcov, json, tty)
3. - K_SOUP_COV_MIN_LINE: Minimum line coverage threshold (integer, e.g., 100)
4. - K_SOUP_COV_MIN_BRANCH: Minimum branch coverage threshold (integer, e.g., 100)
5. - K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD: Fail the run if thresholds are not met (true/false)
6. - K_SOUP_COV_MULTI_FORMATTERS: Enable multiple formatters at once (true/false)
7. - K_SOUP_COV_OPEN_BIN: Path to browser opener for HTML (empty disables auto-open)
8. - MAX_ROWS: Limit console output rows for simplecov-console (e.g., 1)
  Tip: When running a single spec file locally, you may want `K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false` to avoid failing thresholds for a partial run.
GitHub API and CI helpers
1. - GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN: Token used by `ci:act` and release workflow checks to query GitHub Actions status at higher rate limits
Releasing and signing
1. - SKIP_GEM_SIGNING: If set, skip gem signing during build/release
2. - GEM_CERT_USER: Username for selecting your public cert in `certs/<USER>.pem` (defaults to $USER)
3. - SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH: Reproducible build timestamp.
  - `kettle-release` will set this automatically for the session.
  - Not needed on bundler >= 2.7.0, as reproducible builds have become the default.
Git hooks and commit message helpers (exe/kettle-commit-msg)
1. - GIT_HOOK_BRANCH_VALIDATE: Branch name validation mode (e.g., `jira`) or `false` to disable
2. - GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_APPEND: Append a footer to commit messages when goalie allows (true/false)
3. - GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_SENTINEL: Required when footer append is enabled — a unique first-line sentinel to prevent duplicates
4. - GIT_HOOK_FOOTER_APPEND_DEBUG: Extra debug output in the footer template (true/false)
For a quick starting point, this repository’s `mise.toml` defines the shared defaults, and `.env.local` can override them locally. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, use `KEY=value` lines, and either activate `mise` in your shell or run commands through `mise exec -C /path/to/project -- ...`.

## Appraisals

From time to time the [appraisal2][🚎appraisal2] gemfiles in `gemfiles/` will need to be updated.
They are created and updated with the commands:

```console
bin/rake appraisal:update
```

If you need to reset all gemfiles/*.gemfile.lock files:

```console
bin/rake appraisal:reset
```

When adding an appraisal to CI, check the [runner tool cache][🏃‍♂️runner-tool-cache] to see which runner to use.

## The Reek List

Take a look at the open issues and pull requests, or use the gem and find something to improve.

To refresh the `reek` list:

```console
bundle exec reek > REEK
```

## Run Tests

To run all tests

```console
bundle exec rake test
```

Run tests via `kettle-test` (provided by `kettle-test`). It runs RSpec, writes the full log to
`tmp/kettle-test/rspec-TIMESTAMP.log`, and prints a compact highlight block with timing, seed,
pass/fail count, failing example list, and SimpleCov coverage percentages.

```console
bundle exec kettle-test
```

For targeted runs, disable the hard coverage threshold to avoid false failures:

```console
K_SOUP_COV_MIN_HARD=false bundle exec kettle-test spec/path/to/spec.rb
```

### Spec organization (required)

1. - One spec file per class/module. For each class or module under `lib/`, keep all of its unit tests in a single spec file under `spec/` that mirrors the path and file name exactly: `lib/prism/merge/my_class.rb` -> `spec/prism/merge/my_class_spec.rb`.
2. - Exception: Integration specs that intentionally span multiple classes. Place these under `spec/integration/` (or a clearly named integration folder), and do not directly mirror a single class. Name them after the scenario, not a class.

## Lint It

Run all the default tasks, which includes running the gradually autocorrecting linter, `rubocop-gradual`.

```console
bundle exec rake
```

Or just run the linter.

```console
bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect
```

For more detailed information about using RuboCop in this project, please see the [RUBOCOP.md](RUBOCOP.md) guide. This project uses `rubocop_gradual` instead of vanilla RuboCop, which requires specific commands for checking violations.

### Important: Do not add inline RuboCop disables

Never add `# rubocop:disable ...` / `# rubocop:enable ...` comments to code or specs (except when following the few existing `rubocop:disable` patterns for a rule already being disabled elsewhere in the code). Instead:

1. - Prefer configuration-based exclusions when a rule should not apply to certain paths or files (e.g., via `.rubocop.yml`).
2. - When a violation is temporary, and you plan to fix it later, record it in `.rubocop_gradual.lock` using the gradual workflow:
  - `bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:autocorrect` (preferred)
  - `bundle exec rake rubocop_gradual:force_update` (only when you cannot fix the violations immediately)
As a general rule, fix style issues rather than ignoring them. For example, our specs should follow RSpec conventions like using `described_class` for the class under test.

## For Maintainers

### One-time, Per-maintainer, Setup

**IMPORTANT**: To sign a build,
a public key for signing gems will need to be picked up by the line in the
`gemspec` defining the `spec.cert_chain` (check the relevant ENV variables there).
All releases are signed releases.
See: [RubyGems Security Guide][🔒️rubygems-security-guide]

NOTE: To build without signing the gem set `SKIP_GEM_SIGNING` to any value in the environment.

### To release a new version:

#### Automated process

1. Update version.rb to contain the correct version-to-be-released.
2. Run `bundle exec kettle-changelog`.
3. Run `bundle exec kettle-release`.
4. Stay awake and monitor the release process for any errors, and answer any prompts.

#### Manual process

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a "test, coverage, & linting" sanity check
2. Update the version number in `version.rb`, and ensure `CHANGELOG.md` reflects changes
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Run `bin/rake yard` to regenerate the docs site using the canonical docs task
5. Run `git commit -am "🔖 Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
6. Run `git push` to trigger the final CI pipeline before release, and merge PRs
    - NOTE: Remember to [check the build][🧪build].
7. Run `export GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME="$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d ' ' -f5)" && echo $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
8. Run `git checkout $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
9. Run `git pull origin $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME` to ensure latest trunk code
10. Optional for older Bundler (< 2.7.0): Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so `rake build` and `rake release` use the same timestamp and generate the same checksums
    - If your Bundler is >= 2.7.0, you can skip this; builds are reproducible by default.
    - Run `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$EPOCHSECONDS && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
    - If the echo above has no output, then it didn't work.
    - Note: `zsh/datetime` module is needed, if running `zsh`.
    - In older versions of `bash` you can use `date +%s` instead, i.e. `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s) && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
11. Run `bundle exec rake build`
12. Run `bin/gem_checksums` (more context [1][🔒️rubygems-checksums-pr], [2][🔒️rubygems-guides-pr])
    to create SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums. This functionality is provided by the `stone_checksums`
    [gem][💎stone_checksums].
    - The script automatically commits but does not push the checksums
13. Sanity check the SHA256, comparing with the output from the `bin/gem_checksums` command:
    - `sha256sum pkg/<gem name>-<version>.gem`
14. Run `bundle exec rake release` which will create a git tag for the version,
    push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to the gem host configured in the gemspec.
