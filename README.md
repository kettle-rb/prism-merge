## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add prism-merge
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install prism-merge
```

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already; key expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once.  Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install prism-merge -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

## ⚙️ Configuration

## 🔧 Basic Usage

## 🦷 FLOSS Funding

While kettle-rb tools are free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of... "dollars" would make the project more sustainable.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a
wide array of funding channels to account for your preferences
(although currently [Open Collective][🖇osc] is our preferred funding platform).

**If you're working in a company that's making significant use of kettle-rb tools we'd
appreciate it if you suggest to your company to become a kettle-rb sponsor.**

You can support the development of kettle-rb tools via
[GitHub Sponsors][🖇sponsor],
[Liberapay][⛳liberapay],
[PayPal][🖇paypal],
[Open Collective][🖇osc]
and [Tidelift][🏙️entsup-tidelift].

| 📍 NOTE                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If doing a sponsorship in the form of donation is problematic for your company <br/> from an accounting standpoint, we'd recommend the use of Tidelift, <br/> where you can get a support-like subscription instead. |

### Another way to support open-source

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small.  Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions.  I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change <br/>
>—Jordan Harband ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

I understand that policy doesn't work universally ("exceptions to every rule!"),
but it is the policy here.
As such, in many cases it is good to specify a dependency on this library using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("prism-merge", "~> 3.0")
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

SemVer should, IMO, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a *breaking change* to an API, and for that reason the bike shedding is endless.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

- ["Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred"][📌major-versions-not-sacred]

## 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March, and encountering difficulty finding a new one,
I began spending most of my time building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.
