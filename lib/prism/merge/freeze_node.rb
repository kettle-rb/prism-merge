  module Merge
    # Wrapper to represent freeze blocks as first-class nodes.
    # A freeze block is a section marked with freeze/unfreeze comment markers that
    # should be preserved from the destination during merges.
    #
    # Inherits from Ast::Merge::FreezeNodeBase for shared functionality including
    # the Location struct, InvalidStructureError, and configurable marker patterns.
    #
    # Uses the `:hash_comment` pattern type by default for Ruby source files.
    #
    # While freeze blocks are delineated by comment markers, they are conceptually
    # different from CommentNode and do not inherit from it because:
    # - FreezeNodeBase is a *structural directive* that contains code and/or comments
    # - CommentNode represents *pure documentation* with no structural significance
    # - FreezeNodeBase can contain Ruby code nodes (methods, constants, etc.)
    # - CommentNode only contains comments
    # - Their signatures need different semantics for merge matching
    #
    # Freeze blocks can contain other nodes (methods, classes, etc.) and those
    # nodes remain as separate entities within the block for analysis purposes,
    # but the entire freeze block is treated as an atomic unit during merging.
    #
    # @example Freeze block with mixed content
    #   # prism-merge:freeze
    #   # Custom documentation
    #   CUSTOM_CONFIG = { key: "secret" }
    #   def custom_method
    #     # ...
